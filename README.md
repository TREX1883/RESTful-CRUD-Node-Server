# RESTful-CRUD-Node-Server

## For this project, you will built a set of REST APIs using Node and ExpressJS.  You will decide upon some sort of "product" for your API which will allow users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) your items.  Your server will implement the following items:

## Mongoose as your data modeling tool
[Mongoose](https://github.com/TREX1883.com/)

## Cloud-based MongoDB as your data store

## At least 3 endpoints to GET data from your server

## At least 1 endpoint allowing user to update an item via PUT or PATCH HTTP verbs

## At least 1 endpoint allowing user to create an item via POST

## At least 1 endpoint allowing user to delete an item via DELETE

## Your datastore will contain at least 25 items

## Your app will be deployed to production using some service like Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc.

## All of your source code will be properly uploaded to GitHub

## Your ReadMe file will accurately describe the server install process (if any) and how to use the APIs
